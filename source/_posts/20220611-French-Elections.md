At French elections, Macron’s majority is on the line
=====================================================

> If he loses, the president will struggle to keep reforming France. 如果他失败了，总统将很难继续改革法国
-----------------------------------------------------------------


Jun 9th 2022 | PARIS 

Five years ago, a wave of political debutants surged into the French National Assembly. A teacher from Strasbourg, an entrepreneur from Lyon, a farmer from Brittany, a fireman from western France: all these, and many more, won seats for Emmanuel Macron’s centrist party, then called La République en Marche. With allies it bagged 60% of the lower house of parliament, marking a wholesale clear-out that lowered the average age of deputies and filled the assembly with women.

五年前，一波政治新秀涌入法国国民议会。一位来自斯特拉斯堡的教师，一位来自里昂的企业家，一位来自布列塔尼的农民，一位来自法国西部的消防员: 所有这些，以及更多的人，都为埃马纽埃尔 · 马克龙的中间派政党赢得了席位，该政党当时被称为 “前进的共和国”(La République en Marche)。它与盟友一起获得了议会下院 60% 的席位，标志着大规模的清理，降低了议员的平均年龄，议会中充满了妇女。

Today, however, it is Mr Macron’s party that faces an insurgency at the ballot box, which could deprive the re-elected president of his majority and put a stop to any further plans for reforms. On June 12th and 19th voters will elect a new parliament. Nationally, the polls put Ensemble, Mr Macron’s centrist alliance, neck-and-neck with Jean-Luc Mélenchon’s new radical-left grouping nupes, which includes the Socialists, Communists and Greens. Under the two-round first-past-the-post system, Mr Macron’s alliance is likely to remain the biggest. nupes looks set to replace the centre-right Republicans as the main opposition, grabbing at least three times as many seats as both that party and Marine Le Pen’s National Rally. Mr Mélenchon is unlikely to win a majority. But polls suggest that the president could lose his, with a shortfall of anything from 14 to 39 seats.

然而，如今马克龙所在的政党面临着投票箱内的叛乱，这可能会剥夺这位再次当选的总统的多数席位，并阻止任何进一步的改革计划。6 月 12 日和 19 日，选民将选举新的议会。在全国范围内，民意调查显示，马克龙先生的中间派联盟总工会与让 - 吕克 · 梅朗雄新的激进左翼联盟不相上下，其中包括社会党、共产党和绿党。在两轮的 “得票最多者当选” 制度下，马克龙先生的联盟可能仍将是最大的联盟。纽普斯似乎将取代中右翼的共和党成为主要反对党，获得的席位至少是该党和马琳 • 勒庞 (Marine Le Pen) 的全国大会 (National Rally) 的三倍。梅朗雄先生不太可能赢得多数席位。但是民意调查显示，总统可能会失去他的席位，因为缺席的席位从 14 席到 39 席不等。

By swallowing the moderate left, the 70-year-old wisecracking Mr Mélenchon, who admires Venezuela’s Hugo Chávez and wants France out of nato, has forged a potent left-wing movement that has achieved uncommon unity. It appeals in particular to the green-minded, the city-dwelling and the young: 44% of 18- to 24-year-olds back him. This time it is Mr Mélenchon who is fielding the boldest novices, including a baker in eastern France and a chambermaid near Paris. Although he is not even running for re-election, he has also deftly framed the debate around the role he fancies for himself: as Mr Macron’s prime minister. “What will you say to him when you turn up at the Elysée on day one?” asked a radio host.

70 岁的梅朗雄先生崇拜委内瑞拉总统乌戈 • 查韦斯 (Hugo Chávez) ，希望法国退出北约(Nato) ，通过吞并温和的左翼势力，这位爱说俏皮话的梅朗雄先生打造了一个强有力的左翼运动，实现了不同寻常的团结。这对环保主义者、城市居民和年轻人尤其有吸引力: 44% 的 18-24 岁年轻人支持他。这次是梅朗雄先生派出了最大胆的新手，包括法国东部的一位面包师和巴黎附近的一位女服务员。尽管他甚至没有竞选连任，但他也巧妙地围绕自己想要扮演的角色——马克龙的总理——展开了辩论。“当你第一天出现在 Elysée，你会对他说什么?” 一位电台主持人问道。

Sensing this threat, Mr Macron last month named as his new prime minister Elisabeth Borne, an engineer and civil servant who has built her career working for Socialist politicians. Her nomination itself will win few votes on the left, but it marks a shift after Mr Macron’s two previous prime ministers, each of whom hailed from the centre-right. Ms Borne has promised a “food cheque” for the low-paid and other measures to shield the French from inflation. The president has borrowed Mr Mélenchon’s core idea of “green planning” to underpin policymaking. Mr Macron has also named as his new education minister Pap Ndiaye, a historian who has written a lot about race and discrimination.

感受到这种威胁，马克龙上月任命新总理伊丽莎白 • 伯恩 (Elisabeth Borne) 为首相。她是一名工程师和公务员，职业生涯始于为社会党政客工作。她的提名本身不会在左翼赢得多少选票，但它标志着在马克龙前两任总理之后的一个转变，这两位总理都来自中右翼。伯恩女士承诺为低收入人群提供 “食品支票”，并采取其他措施保护法国免受通货膨胀的影响。总统借用了梅伦雄先生“绿色规划” 的核心理念来支持政策制定。马克龙先生还任命了新的教育部长帕普 · 恩迪亚耶(Pap Ndiaye) ，这位历史学家写了很多关于种族和歧视的文章。

Much done, much still to do 做了很多，还有很多要做
---------------------------


Mr Macron enjoys sweeping powers under the French constitution, including the right to pass laws with minimal parliamentary oversight and to appoint the prime minister. But, politically, he still needs a working majority to finish what he started in his first term. This includes a reform of the pension system, which would increase the retirement age from 62 years to 64 or 65. At stake in the parliamentary vote, in other words, is whether Mr Macron can continue as an economic reformer and moderniser of the French welfare state.

根据法国宪法，马克龙享有广泛的权力，包括在议会监督最少的情况下通过法律和任命总理的权利。但是，在政治上，他仍然需要工作上的多数来完成他在第一个任期内开始的工作。这包括改革养老金制度，将退休年龄从 62 岁提高到 64 或 65 岁。换句话说，议会投票的关键在于马克龙先生能否继续作为法国福利国家的经济改革者和现代化者。

The answer will be a firm no if Mr Mélenchon pulls off a surprise and secures a majority. Mr Macron has hinted that he would refuse to name him prime minister. But he would find it extremely hard not to—just as Jacques Chirac, a Gaullist, appointed Lionel Jospin, a Socialist, after losing his majority in 1997. In the job Mr Mélenchon would seek to reverse most of Mr Macron’s reforms, which have encouraged private investment and job creation. He promises, among other things, to reduce the pension age to 60 years, undo liberalising labour-market reforms, restore the wealth tax, and increase the net minimum wage by 15% to €1,500 ($1,600) a month. Two of his candidates in Paris invited Jeremy Corbyn, Britain’s radical former Labour leader, to campaign with them.

如果梅朗雄先生出人意料地获得多数席位，答案将是坚决的否定。马克龙已经暗示，他将拒绝任命他为总理。但他会发现很难不这样做ーー就像戴高乐主义者雅克 • 希拉克 (Jacques Chirac) 在 1997 年失去多数党地位后，任命社会党人莱昂内尔 • 若斯潘 (Lionel Jospin) 为总统一样。在任职期间，梅朗雄先生将寻求推翻马克龙先生的大部分改革措施，这些措施鼓励了私人投资和创造就业机会。他承诺，除其他事项外，将退休年龄降低到 60 岁，取消自由化的劳动力市场改革，恢复财富税，并将最低工资净额提高 15% ，达到每月 1500 欧元 (1600 美元)。他在巴黎的两位候选人邀请英国激进的前工党领袖杰里米 • 科尔宾(Jeremy Corbyn) 与他们一起竞选。

Still, the chances are that Mr Macron either holds on to a shrunken majority, which would enable him to press on, or loses it, which would spell trouble. The president would then need either to stitch together a voting majority with unallied deputies, or seek a formal coalition. Yet, having crushed the mainstream parties with his centrist bloc, Mr Macron finds himself alone against the extremes, with few options; the centre-right Republicans show little interest in helping him.

尽管如此，马克龙先生仍有可能继续保持缩小的多数席位，这将使他能够继续施压，或者失去多数席位，这将意味着麻烦。届时，总统要么需要组建一个有投票权的多数党，要么寻求一个正式的联合政府。然而，在用他的中间集团击败了主流政党之后，马克龙先生发现自己孤军奋战，几乎没有选择; 中间偏右的共和党人对帮助他没有什么兴趣。

The campaign has failed to stir enthusiasm. “People think that the legislatives are just a vote of confirmation, to give the president a majority, which isn’t very motivating,” says Mathieu Gallard, of Ipsos, a pollster. Indeed, by keeping the campaign low-key Mr Macron may have hoped to set up the vote as the natural sequel to the presidential result. Yet the upshot so far has been more of a sense of drift. This has allowed Mr Mélenchon to set the agenda, and damaging events, such as the policing fiasco at a recent European football final, to dominate. “Every seat will be a fight,” says one of Mr Macron’s deputies. The government is on the line. Ministers who fail to get elected, including Ms Borne, who is standing in Normandy, would have to go.

这场运动未能激起人们的热情。民意调查机构益普索 (Ipsos) 的马修 • 加拉德 (Mathieu Gallard) 表示: “人们认为，立法机构只是一次确认投票，目的是让总统获得多数席位，这并不是很有动力。”。事实上，通过保持竞选的低调，马克龙先生可能希望把投票作为总统选举结果的自然结果。然而，迄今为止的结果更多的是一种漂移感。这使得梅朗雄先生能够设定议程，而破坏性事件，例如最近欧洲足球决赛中的警务惨败，则占据了主导地位。“每个席位都将是一场战斗,”马克龙先生的一位副手表示。政府在线上。那些未能当选的部长，包括站在诺曼底的伯恩女士，将不得不下台。

Mr Macron has form defeating the extremes. There is plenty to deplore in Mr Mélenchon’s manifesto, not least its pledge to breach parts of European Union law or to phase out French nuclear energy. During the presidential campaign Mr Macron clinically exposed the contradictions of Ms Le Pen’s promises. Now he needs to do the same to Mr Mélenchon’s. ■

马克龙先生有能力打败极端分子。梅朗雄先生的宣言中有很多令人遗憾的地方，尤其是他违反部分欧盟法律或逐步淘汰法国核能的承诺。在总统竞选期间，马克龙先生临床地揭露了勒庞女士承诺的矛盾。现在他需要对梅伦雄先生做同样的事情。￭
